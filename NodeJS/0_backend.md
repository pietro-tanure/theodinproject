# What is a back-end?

The back-end is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts:

1. The server. This is the computer that receives requests.
2. The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.
3.  The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.
