### Create tables

CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, nickname TEXT, location TEXT);

CREATE TABLE badgers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, points INTEGER);

INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, "Saul", "California")
INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, "John", "New York")


#### Groceries
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);

INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 56, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(2, "Peanut Butter", 1, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(3, "Dark Chocolate Bars", 2, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(4, "Ice cream", 1, 12);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(5, "Cherries", 6, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(6, "Chocolate syrup", 1, 4);

SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle;
SELECT * FROM groceries
SELECT name FROM groceries 

### order (ORDER BY)
SELECT * FROM groceries ORDER BY aisle

### filter (WHERE)
SELECT * 
FROM groceries 
WHERE aisle > 1 
ORDER BY aisle

### agregate functions (SUM, MIN, MAX)
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries;

SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle;

SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle;

### nested
SELECT * FROM family_members WHERE num_legs = (SELECT MIN(num_legs) FROM family_members);
